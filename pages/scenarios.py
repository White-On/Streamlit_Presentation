        "To conduct our experiments effectively, we are creating five scenarios to \
                observe the results of our model in different dynamic environments. Most of \
                these scenarios are inspired by the article *[Kabtoul, Maria, Manon PrÃ©dhumeau, \
                Anne Spalanzani, Julie Dugdale, et Philippe Martinet. Â«Â How To Evaluate the \
                Navigation of Autonomous Vehicles Around Pedestrians?Â Â» IEEE Transactions on \
                Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2024, 1â€‘11. \
                https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2023.3323662]* and video that follow. \n\
    1. **Opposite Direction Collision**: In this scenario, the vehicle collides with another \
                vehicle moving in the opposite direction. \n\
    2. **Same Direction Collision**: Similar to the first scenario, but both vehicles have \
                the same goal direction. However, as the car will have a faster speed goal, \
                we expect different behavior.\n\
    3. **Lateral Encounter with Crowd**: This scenario \
                is well represented in the video, involving a lateral \
                encounter between the vehicle and a crowd of pedestrians.\n\
    4. **Encounter with Two Pedestrian Crowds**: In this more complex scenario, \
                the vehicle encounters two pedestrian crowds, and the car must navigate \
                through them.\n\
    5. **Shared Space with Random Pedestrian Movements**: The last scenario represents \
        a shared space with pedestrians moving randomly around. The car needs to navigate \
            in this chaotic environment. \n\n\
    By testing our model in these diverse scenarios, we aim to gain insights into \
                its performance and behavior in various dynamic situations and avoid **overfitting**."
